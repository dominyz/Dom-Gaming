Like I was planning to, here's the release for standard usual / steady cycles version. It's still an improvement over a simple sequence script. 
This one has quick release and is really easy to tweak for perfect timings / different keybinds.

With my default built in timings, I start at 3 o'clock in lightning and hold the key. It comes back at the same spot in the next arcane. If not, tweak timings in town for your computer/latency.

F2 to pop-up menu. Left click is electrocute, Right click is arcane torrent.

You can use both scripts at the same time because they store info in different INIs. Switch between hotkeys depending on trash density / APOC you get. First one for low trash situations, and standard one for good barbs situations.(modifi√©)
